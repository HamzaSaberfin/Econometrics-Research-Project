# Econometrics-Research-Project
The aim of the project is to investigate the dynamic causal effects of the monetary policy of the european central bank and the federal reserve on the main european rates.  We estimated the static and dynamic impacts of forward guidance on EURIBOR using different maturities. Indeed, we have used Krippner shocks based on the daily changes of shadow rates to capture the effect of the announcement. Moreover, we have used an ARCH model so as to manage the clustering of volatility.  The empirical results show that the announcements of the ECB has a great impact on long maturities compared to the shortest one.
